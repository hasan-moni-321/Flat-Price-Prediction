 ## Flat Price Prediction Using Machine Learing and Deep Learning


 ## About Dataset
 This is a regression problem. It's aim is to predict the price of flat in different area in Bangladesh.
 
 ## Key Works
 1. data cleaning  
 2. feature engineering and outlier detection, removing  
 3. Hyperparameter tuning with different machine learning model
 4. Using Deep Learning of both tensorflow and pytorch
 5.
